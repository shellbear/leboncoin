- `limit` integer
- `str1` string
- `str2` string

#### Example

## ü§ñ CI

A CI is running on every push thanks to [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
This CI contains a [lint](.github/workflows/lint.yml) and a [build](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflows.

That follows the best Go lint practices and test the build on every code changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

- `PORT` The web endpoint listening port (default: `8080`)
- `HOST` The web endpoint listening address (default: `0.0.0.0`)
